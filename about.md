__Shannon__ is a program for assembling transcripts from RNA-Seq data. It is based on an information-theoretic approach to assembly that seeks to establish both necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal assembly as well as algorithms for achieving optimal assembly. 


__Shannon__ is a collaborative effort between three universities: Sreeram Kannan at University of Washington, Lior Pachter at University of California, Berkeley and David Tse at Stanford University. The programming of __Shannon__ was led by Sreeram Kannan and carried out by Joseph Hui and Kayvon Mazooji.

__Shannon__ was partially funded by the NSF Center for Science of Information, NIH NHGRI and a startup grant at the University of Washington.
